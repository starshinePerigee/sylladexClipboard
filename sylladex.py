prototypes:
///protokey: keyboard evesdropping
///protocb: clipboard management
protowm: WX UI overlay and main window
protopicture: turn clipboard info into graphical cards
///prototopwidget: WX tray icon
protoobvs: prototype observer pattern for passing data

some random cool functions you could add as data types:

regex find/replace filters
combine as variables into longer strings
paste when copied
copy/paste keypress strings
plaintext vs formatting
format speccubus

"filter" cards which only accept certain types (combine into other cards)

sillier moduses: calculator, etc
even sillier: call directly into terminal / other paste recievers
(programs as captchalog cards)
"chastity modus" which only pastes if the recieving window can accept the
first clipboard type
